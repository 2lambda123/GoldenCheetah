Data:

Get 12 packets of 1542 (0x606) bytes each.  
Where is that encoded?

Each row is 6 bytes.  
Rows that start with 0x8? are the data for one period.

Column  Meaning         Format                              
1       ???
2, n1   torque          4 most sig bits, N m
2, n2   km/h            4 most sig bits, 0x24000 / value * 0.1
3       torque          8 least sig bits, N m
4       km/h            8 least sig bits, 0x24000 / value * 0.1
5       Cadence         1-byte integer
6       Heartrate       1-byte integer
                              

First row is always:

57 56 55 64 02 15                              

Base period in thousands of a minute = 0x15...


A row starting with 0x60 encodes the time of day that measurements started.
This is always the second record in the stream.  Also, when the computer goes
to sleep and then wakes up again, it writes one of these records first.

Example: 60 06 04 9c 2a 30                              

byte 2                  year
byte 3                  month
byte 4, bottom 5 bits   day
byte 5, bottom 5 bits   hour
byte 6, bottom 6 bits   minute

top 3 bits of byte 4 followed by top 3 bits of byte 5 is pretty close to the
right seconds value, but not perfect...

               
A row starting with 0x40 encodes:

  bytes 2-3     the wheel circumference in mm
  byte 4        the interval number
  byte 5        the recording interval, where

                byte value      interval
                0x0             1
                0x1             2
                0x3             5
                0x7             10
                0x17            30

Example:

40 08 30 02 07 00
   wheel size in mm = 0x0830               
   interval 2
   recording interval 10
