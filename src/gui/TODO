 - Power distribution histogram: Rob Carlsen said:
        
        I believe that it displays the percentage of time that you've spent in
        various power ranges, however you can change that to display the
        absolute time you've spent in each range. the default is 20 watt
        increments, but the recommendation in the book is to decrease the
        granularity to 10 watt increments for better estimation of your FTP.

        i thought that using this chart to estimate FTP would only be useful
        when there were MANY workout files compiled, rather than looking at
        one workout. all the charts on the "athlete home page" of WKO+ seem to
        display a collection of past workouts, usually about the last 28 days.
