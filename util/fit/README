FITmetadata.json generator

For Garmin device updates:
    Make sure you download the latest FIT SDK from thisisant.com and extract
    the c/fit_example.h file and place it in this directory.

For non-Garmin device updates:
    Update the file nongarmin.json to add the manufacturer and product combination
    and associated description. See existing values in there as examples. Note
    that a product number of -1 is to set the default description for any device
    from that manufacturer that is not defined

Once the updates have been made you can regenerate FITmetadata.json with:
    $ make

A new FITmetadata.json file will be created in the current directory,
