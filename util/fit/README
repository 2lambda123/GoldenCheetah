FITmetadata.json generator

For Garmin device updates:

    Make sure you download the latest FIT SDK from thisisant.com and extract
    the c/fit_example.h file and place it in this directory.

    Do not edit this file, we expect it to be lifted directly from the SDK
    and it will be replaced as new versions of the SDK are released

When Garmin devices are not yet supported by the SDK

    The SDK lags behind device availability in this case you should add
    the Garmin device to the nongarmin.json file, this will override any
    value found in the Garmin SDK and is typically because a device is 
    reported by a user at the forums before the SDK is updated or is a
    legacy device that Garmin no longer supports.

For non-Garmin device updates:

    Update the file nongarmin.json to add the manufacturer and product combination
    and associated description. See existing values in there as examples. Note
    that a product number of -1 is to set the default description for any device
    from that manufacturer that is not defined


Once the updates have been made you can regenerate FITmetadata.json with:
    $ make

A new FITmetadata.json file will be created in the src/Resources/json directory,
