<p>Sean Rhea bought a PowerTap Pro on April 20, 2006 and immediately set
to figuring out how to use it from his Mac without using Virtual PC.
With help from Russ Cox and David Easter, he wrote two command-line
programs for downloading data from a PowerTap and interpreting that
data.  Sean released these two tools, <code>ptdl</code> and
<code>ptunpk</code>, on May 4, 2006.</p>

<p>Later that year, Sean needed to learn QT for his real job, and he set
about writing a graphical version of his software for practice.  He
released the first graphical version on September 6, 2006, changing the
name to GoldenCheetah in reference to an old legend from his days as a
runner.</p>

<p>Since then, a large community has contributed additional code and
other support, including:</p>
