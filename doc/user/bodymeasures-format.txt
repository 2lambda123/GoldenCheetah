---------------------------------------------------------------------

Example is provided here:

----
ts,weightkg,fatkg,boneskg,musclekg,leankg,fatpercent,comment
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,Is a technically valid entry, but the timestamp is 1 second of Epoch
1479632565,80.15,12.10,5.4,0,32.5,1157,Test Value
----

a) Header Line
First Line of a valid file has to contain header information. This has to be a comma-separated 
list of the measures provided in the data lines. You do not need to provide all possible measures,
but at least "ts" and "weightkg".

The mandatory measures are:
- "ts" 			- Unix timestamp (in seconds) since Epoch. The value can be calcuated in XLS - just Google how-to.
- "weightkg" 	- Athlete weight in kilograms

The optional measures are:
- "fatkg" 		- Fat mass in kg
- "boneskg" 	- Bone mass in kg
- "musclekg"	- Muscle mass in kg
- "leankg"		- Lean mass in kg
- "fatpercent"	- Fat percentage
- "comment"		- A description of the measures

Data formats:

- "ts" 		is a 64Bit Integer - any other time will be rejected
- "comment"	is a String
- all other measures are float/double in format <xxxxxxx.yyy> 

There are very strict format checks when importing. Only if the whole
file is correct the data is imported. Any error (even in a single entry)
will block the complete import.

The following error will stop the import.
- Unknown measures in header
- Number of measures in header is different to number in an item
- Item measure in wrong format
- "ts" or "weightkg" is missing
